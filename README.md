# pyprinttree

Use it to print a pretty text based tree representation of whatever data
you feel like shoving into the graph structure.

_I like `git log --oneline --graph --all` and find it handy to be able
to generate similar graphs._


## Development

Pull requests are encouraged.

I will merge failing tests if they highlight an issue.

The official test suite runner for pyprinttree is `setup.py test`.
